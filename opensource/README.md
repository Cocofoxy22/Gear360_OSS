# Open Source Code

Note: Samsung have not yet removed the Gear 360 (2016) open source code from their servers, so you can also download the files from [here](https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadSearch?searchValue=c200).

Unfortunately, Samsung do not appear to have ever released the source code for the 2017 model (R210).

Mirrors of the source code zips can be found on [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-port-samsung-gear-360-manager-for-all-devices-updated-10-jan-20-v1-4-00-4.3400383/post-84320639) XDA forum post, as follows:
